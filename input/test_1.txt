Donald Trump continues to court Second Amendment supporters in the wake of last week’s deadly shooting in Oregon, suggesting the teachers at Umpqua Community College should have been armed — just like he is.

“Let me tell you, if you had a couple teachers with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off,” Trump said at a rally in Franklin, Tenn., on Saturday. “This is about self-defense, plain and simple.”

“In fact, I have a license to carry in New York — can you believe that? Nobody knows that,” Trump continued. “Somebody attacks me, they’re gonna be shocked.”

After the event, the Republican frontrunner told reporters that he is a member of the National Rifle Association, and had consulted the group in developing his gun policy.
